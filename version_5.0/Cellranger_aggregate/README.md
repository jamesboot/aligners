# Cellranger Aggregate
#### What is Cellranger aggr?
Many experiments involve generating data for multiple samples that are processed through different Gel Bead-in Emulsion (GEM) wells on Chromium instruments. Depending on the experimental design, these could be replicates from the same set of cells, cells from different tissues or time points from the same individual, or cells from different individuals. The cellranger aggr pipeline can be used to aggregate these into a single feature-barcode matrix.
